# Engine2

My first C++ game engine.  
I am no longer expanding this project, as Iâ€™ve moved on to more efficient designs that are rapildy growing.

### Overview

Engine2 is a lightweight experimental C++ game engine built around **OpenGL**.  
It combines rendering, physics, and procedural terrain to provide a simple sandbox for experimenting with game engine concepts.  

---

### Key Features
- **OpenGL-based rendering**
- **Multiple libraries integrated** for graphics, physics, and math
- **JSON parsing** for loading geometry files
- **PhysX physics engine** for realistic collisions and interactions
- **Procedural terrain** generation using Noise
- **Two camera modes**
  - Free-fly camera  
  - First-person style walking/jumping camera  
- **Player movement mechanics**
  - **Walk:** Arrow keys  
  - **Jump:** Spacebar  
  - **Fly:** `E` (up), `Q` (down)  
  - **Open doors:** `F`
  - **Change Cameras** `C`
- **Collision handling** (player vs. world and objects)
